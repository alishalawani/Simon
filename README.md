# SIMON

## Description

My app is called Simon. It's a web app version of the Digital Simon game. The program chooses a sequence of colors and makes the player repeat the same sequence to advance to the next round, with the sequence getting more difficult to follow in every round.The player's score from every round adds up as the game progresses. Users will have the option to play again. In the future, I'd like to add a feature where one player can play against another player.

### How to play:

On every round, click 'start' and a message will pop up saying 'WATCH' as the game makes chooses a number of colors, the number of colors chosen for every round is determined by the round number. When the game finishes making it's choices, it will display a 'Your Turn!" message indicating that it's your turn to repeat the same sequence before advancing to the next round.
If you fail a round, 1 point gets deducted from your score and you have the choice of clicking 'replay' to replay that round as much as you want until you win, and you have the choice of resetting the game.

#### Future additions:

In the future, I would like to add a time scoring feature, and a click preventer for when players mistakenly click the buttons when it isn't their turn, so it doesn't affect the game.
