# Project Proposal

## Simon

## Project Description

My app is called Simon. It's a web app version of the Digital Simon game. The program chooses a sequence of colors and makes the player repeat the same sequence to advance to the next round, with the sequence getting more difficult to follow in every round.The player's score from every round adds up as the game progresses -- whichever player won, or in the case of a draw, a tie between the users. Users will have the option to play again. In the future, I'd like to add a feature where one player can play against the computer.

## User Stories

#### MVP Goals

- As a player, I want to be able to click a start button so that the sequence I have to repeat only starts when I am ready to play.
- As a player, I would like to have a choice to replay the round when I fail, so that I don't start from the beginning every time I fail
- As a player, I would like to know what round I am in, incase I lose track.
- As a player, I would like to see a victory or loss message to know if I won the round or not
- As a player who requires assistive technologies, I would like accessibility features so that I'm not left out of enjoying the game.
- As a player I would like to be able to restart the game after a win or loss.
- As a player I would like to see a glow on each color as the program moves through the sequence of colors for me to know how to be able to repeat the sequence.
- As a player, I want the UI to be engaging and out of the way so that I enjoy the experience of playing the game.\*\*

#### Stretch Goals

- As a player, I would like a victory animation when I win the game, so that I feel good about my victory!
- As a player, I would like to hear an audible sound as each color gets clicked to help me to better follow the sequence
- As a player I would like to hear different sounds for each color so I can keep track of the sequence incase I look away and don't see when a color glows.
